# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Ycorp understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Ycorp is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Ycorp has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Ycorp Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

## 18.2 Data Retention Policy

* Current Ycorp Customers have data stored by Ycorp as a part of the Ycorp Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Ycorp and/or to have Ycorp continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Ycorp will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Ycorp within 30 days, Ycorp removes data from Ycorp systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
